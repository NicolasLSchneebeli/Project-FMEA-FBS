    "\n",
    "### Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Components are the container for the whole system: They will hold all the attributes and also be the input of the simulation as a list of components\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - To create a component: $\\textcolor{red}{Component(name=\\textit{STRING})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To create add an Attribute to it: $\\textcolor{red}{COMPONENT.addAttribute(name=ATTRIBUTE)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To view all Attributes being currently a part of the Component: $\\textcolor{red}{COMPONENT.getAttributes()}$\n",

    "### Propriety:\n",
    "\n",

    "    - To view to which component this attribute is linked: $\\textcolor{red}{ATTRIBUTE.getComponent()}$\n",
